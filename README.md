# CustomerSegmentation
 In this project, I conducted customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform to improve marketing strategies and personalize customer experiences.
Customer Segmentation Project: Music Store

Overview

This project aims to segment customers of a global music store based on their preferences and identify the top 10 customers, along with their favorite music genres and artists. Understanding customer preferences can help the music store tailor its marketing strategies and recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction and increase sales.

Data

The dataset used for this analysis contains customer information, purchase history, and music genre and artist preferences. It includes the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
FirstName and LastName: Customer's first and last name.
Email: Customer's email address.
GenrePreference: Preferred music genre(s).
ArtistPreference: Favorite artist(s).
TotalSpent: Total amount spent by the customer.
PurchaseDate: Date of the last purchase.
Methodology

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values were handled, and data types were converted as needed.
Customer Segmentation: Customers were segmented into groups based on their music genre and artist preferences using clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means).
Top 10 Customers: The top 10 customers were identified based on the total amount spent (TotalSpent) and their preferences for genres and artists.
Favorite Genres and Artists: For the top 10 customers, their favorite music genres and artists were extracted from the dataset.
